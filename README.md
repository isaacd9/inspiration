"Without the prospect of publication, the closest most people come to writing
essays is to write in a journal. I find I never get as deeply into subjects as
I do in proper essays. As the name implies, you don't go back and rewrite
journal entries over and over for two weeks." -

"When we look back on the desktop software era, I think we'll marvel at the
inconveniences people put up with, just as we marvel now at what early car
owners put up with. For the first twenty or thirty years, you had to be a car
expert to own a car. But cars were such a big win that lots of people who
weren't car experts wanted to have them as well." -
